## Parallelizing transfer of data by 1D and 2D demcomposition

We have used following files :
- **ass.c** : Contains  the MPI program to perform the following computation for the elements in the lower triangular matrix of a square matrix A of dimension n X n for 1D rowwise and 2D domain decomposition schemes
- **report.pdf **: Comparision of the timings,  coding methodology, observations and plots for 1D rowwise and 2D domain decomposition schemes
